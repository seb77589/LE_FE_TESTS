/**
 * Unit Tests for Permission Utilities
 *
 * REMOVED: Permission utilities tests
 * The @/lib/auth/permissions module was removed in v0.2.0 as part of the
 * authentication architecture consolidation. Permission checks are now
 * handled directly in ConsolidatedAuthContext via role-based access control.
 *
 * For current authentication patterns, see:
 * - @/lib/context/ConsolidatedAuthContext.tsx
 * - CLAUDE.md section on Frontend Authentication Architecture
